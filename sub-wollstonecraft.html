								<p>
									Wollstonecraft mainly advocated for the rights of education for women. 
									Us viewing that argument as non-controversial in the present is a testament of her success.
									But during her time, many philosophers, such as Rousseau, 
									argued that women should not have a formal education due to their “child-like innocence” and should be subservient to men. 
									Wollstonecraft wrote the following retort to Rousseau’s arguments:
								</p>
								<blockquote>
									"[Rousseau] carries the arguments, which he pretends to draw from the indications of nature, still further, 
									and insinuates that truth and fortitude, 
									the corner stones of all human virtue, should be cultivated with certain restrictions, 
									because, with respect to the female character, 
									obedience is the grand lesson which we ought to be impressed with unrelenting rigour" (Wollstonecraft 25).
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									By using Rousseau's own interpretation of nature as the basis of her analysis, 
									Wollstonecraft suggests that his arguments about women intellect are completely speculatory. 
									Although current critics of Wollstonecraft claim that she did not do enough to further the rights of women, we must contextualize her views. 
									It is important to remember that her stances were already considered unorthodox by society, 
									and pushing for more “radical” philosophies might have entirely prevented her ideas from being considered by her contemporaries. 
									Liberation is an ongoing process, a movement, an evolution along time. 
									While Wollstonecraft’s beliefs may be considered conservative by today’s standards, 
									her legacy inspired those who organized the First Wave of Feminism in the late 19th and early 20th century, 
									which was the basis for the women’s suffrage and property rights movements and modern-day feminism.
